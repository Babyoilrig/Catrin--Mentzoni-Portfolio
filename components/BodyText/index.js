    <p class="text-left font-roboto text-xl">Hi, my name is Cat and I grew up near Pwllheli in North West Wales. During early teens in the mid-1990s I got my first home computer, and spent hours learning 
about different programs and spending time on the internet. I even completed an AS Level in Computer 
Programming in 2000, in which I learned to code in the ‘Delphi’ language. </p>
<br/><br/>
<p class="text-left font-roboto text-xl">Even though I enjoyed working with computers, I ended up studying business studies at university, 
and after leaving university in 2006, I started my own events business “ Curb Promotions” which specialised 
in hosting music events. In 2010, I spent two years in Cambodia first volunteering with his Cambodians children charity 
(Camkids.org) and then working as a teacher in the capital Phnom Penh. </p>
<br/><br/>   
<p class="text-left font-roboto text-xl">On returning to the UK in 2012, I trained to be a primary school teacher, a job which I did for 
10 years. Although I enjoyed the job, the lack of opportunities to learn new skills, and the lack of challenge motivated me to begin looking for a new career path. 
<br/><br/>   
<p class="text-left font-roboto text-xl"></p>During spring 2021 I read some articles regarding the skills shortage in the software
 engineering sector which mentioned the School of Code and they’re amazing bootcamp. During the summer I decided to apply for the course. Although the bootcamp was extremely challenging, I soon regained my love of coding!</p>
