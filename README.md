This repository is my developer profile.

The hosted version of this repo can be viewed here: www.catrinmentzoni.com

It contains information on my individual background, journey, skills and CV etc.

I created this project using Next.JS, Tailwind CSS and some CSS3.

I chose to build the project using Next.js, as I had not used it before â€“ in order to learn more about it (and also because I enjoy a new challenge).

NB - This is my second attempt at building this portfolio. I originally created it using Next.js, Next UI and CSS - but unfortunately I was having difficulty with mobile compatibility. The original repo can be viewed [HERE](https://github.com/Babyoilrig/CatrinMentzoni-Portfolio)
